#Daily AI News Summary

<think>
Alright, I need to help the user by summarizing AI news articles into markdown format. The user has provided specific instructions, so I should make sure to follow each point carefully. 

First, I'll review the instructions. The user wants each news item to include the date in **YYYY-MM-DD** format using the IST timezone. Then, a concise summary, sorted by date with the latest first, and each summary should link to the source URL. The format should be ### [Date] followed by a list item with the summary as a hyperlink.

Looking at the provided content, I see multiple articles from different dates. I'll need to extract the date, convert it to IST if necessary, and write a brief summary. 

I'll start by identifying the dates. The first article is from June 30, 2025. The title mentions Europe's AI gigafactory attracting 76 bids. The summary should capture that the EU's tech chief is pushing this initiative, making it a significant development.

Next, there's an article about Meta seeking $29B for AI and hiring OpenAI talent. This is also June 30, so it's another top story. I'll note that Meta is investing heavily and poaching talent, which shows their commitment to AI.

Another June 30 article discusses DeepSeek's AI model being powered by a Chinese chipmaker, which is part of China's effort to reduce dependence on foreign chips. This is important in the context of the global AI race.

Moving to June 27, there's a report on women engineering students showing interest in AI/ML careers. This diversity aspect is crucial and should be highlighted.

June 26 has an article about Dell Technologies encouraging an AI-first mindset. This is motivational and indicates a shift in corporate strategies towards AI adoption.

There's another June 26 piece on Adda Education pushing into skilling beyond test prep, which ties into workforce development in AI.

On June 25, an article talks about cybercriminals using malicious AI, a growing concern in cybersecurity. This is a timely issue as AI's role in both creating and solving security problems becomes more prominent.

I'll make sure each summary is concise and links correctly. I also need to sort them by date, with the latest first. I'll check the URLs to ensure they're correctly formatted as links.

I should be careful to avoid any markdown formatting in the thinking process, as per the user's request. Once I have all the summaries ready, I'll present them in the specified markdown format, ensuring each date is correctly converted to IST if needed, though the provided dates seem to already be in a compatible format.

I also need to ensure that the output is exactly as the user provided, with each date as a header and each summary as a linked list item. No additional text should be included beyond what's specified.

Finally, I'll review the entire response to make sure it's properly formatted and all links are functional. This should meet the user's requirements accurately.
