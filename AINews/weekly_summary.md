#Weekly AI News Summary

<think>
Okay, I need to summarize these AI news articles into markdown format. Let me go through each one step by step.

First, I'll look at the user's instructions. They want each news item to include the date in YYYY-MM-DD format in IST timezone, a concise summary, sorted by date with the latest first, and the source URL as a link. The format should be ### [Date] followed by a bullet point with the summary and URL.

I'll start by parsing each article's content, date, and URL. I'll need to convert the given dates from GMT to IST. IST is UTC+5:30, so I'll add 5 hours and 30 minutes to each GMT date.

For example, the first article has a GMT date of 2025-06-27. Adding 5:30 hours, it becomes 2025-06-28. Wait, no, the user provided the date as "Fri, 27 Jun 2025 04:36:01 GMT" which converts to IST as 2025-06-27 10:06:01. So the date in IST is 2025-06-27.

I'll do this conversion for each article. I also need to ensure that the dates are sorted from latest to earliest.

Next, I'll create a concise summary for each article. I'll read the content and extract the key points without making the sentences too long.

Once all summaries are ready, I'll sort them by date, ensuring the most recent comes first.

I should also check for any duplicate articles or content to avoid repetition.

I'll format each entry as specified: ### [Date] followed by a bullet point with the summary linked to the URL.

I need to make sure the URLs are correctly formatted as hyperlinks in markdown.

After compiling all the entries, I'll review the list to ensure it meets all the user's requirements: correct dates, concise summaries, proper sorting, and correct URLs.

I think that's all. Let me proceed to summarize each article accordingly.
