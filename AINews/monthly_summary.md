#Monthly AI News Summary

<think>
Okay, so I need to help the user by summarizing these AI news articles into a markdown format. Let me look at the instructions again. They want each item to include the date in YYYY-MM-DD format in IST timezone, a concise summary, sorted by date with the latest first, and the source URL as a link.

First, I need to process each article one by one. I'll start by converting the given dates from GMT to IST. I remember that IST is GMT+5:30, so I'll add 5 hours and 30 minutes to each date. 

Looking at the first article, the date is Fri, 27 Jun 2025 04:36:01 GMT. Adding 5:30 makes it 2025-06-27 10:06:01 IST, so the date is 2025-06-27. The summary should be about India's workforce embracing GenAI tools more than the global average. The URL is provided, so I'll link that.

Next, the second article is from Tue, 17 Jun 2025 08:21:05 GMT. Converting that, it becomes 2025-06-17 13:51:05 IST, so the date is 2025-06-17. The summary is about Karnataka launching an AI study for their IT policy. The URL is there, so I'll include it.

The third article is from Mon, 30 Jun 2025 11:22:21 GMT. Adding 5:30 gives 2025-06-30 16:52:21 IST, so the date is 2025-06-30. The summary mentions the global leisure travel market tripling by 2040, with the correct URL.

Fourth, the article from Wed, 04 Jun 2025 16:15:35 GMT becomes 2025-06-04 21:45:35 IST, so the date is 2025-06-04. The summary is about Meraqui's Workforce OS for Bharat using AI. URL is provided.

Fifth, the article from Mon, 30 Jun 2025 15:46:41 GMT converts to 2025-06-30 21:16:41 IST, so date is 2025-06-30. The summary is about Europe's AI gigafactory attracting bids, with the URL.

Sixth, the article from Sun, 01 Jun 2025 10:22:01 GMT becomes 2025-06-01 15:52:01 IST, date 2025-06-01. The summary is about AI driving faster change in tech and business in 2025, with the correct URL.

Seventh, the article from Wed, 18 Jun 2025 13:49:35 GMT converts to 2025-06-18 19:19:35 IST, date 2025-06-18. The summary is about an AI app using selfie cameras to detect depression, with the URL.

Eighth, the article from Wed, 11 Jun 2025 11:50:34 GMT becomes 2025-06-11 17:20:34 IST, date 2025-06-11. The summary is about Google offering buyout options to reduce workforce, with the URL.

Ninth, the article from Tue, 17 Jun 2025 08:21:07 GMT converts to 2025-06-17 13:51:07 IST, date 2025-06-17. The summary is again about Karnataka's AI Impact Study, with the URL.

Tenth, the article from Wed, 18 Jun 2025 12:17:59 GMT becomes 2025-06-18 17:47:59 IST, date 2025-06-18. The summary is about new malicious AI variants, with the URL.

Eleventh, the article from Fri, 06 Jun 2025 13:01:36 GMT converts to 2025-06-06 18:31:36 IST, date 2025-06-06. The summary is about ABN AMRO launching a banking service for young customers using AI, with the URL.

Twelfth, the article from Thu, 19 Jun 2025 01:45:04 GMT becomes 2025-06-19 07:15:04 IST, date 2025-06-19. The summary is about Amazon's workforce shrinking due to AI, with the URL.

Thirteenth, the article from Fri, 13 Jun 2025 03:55:00 GMT converts to 2025-06-13 09:25:00 IST, date 2025-06-13. The summary is about a hybrid IT revolution for sustainability and innovation, with the URL.

Fourteenth, the article from Wed, 11 Jun 2025 15:35:15 GMT becomes 2025-06-11 21:05:15 IST, date 2025-06-11. The summary is about OpenAI's $500 billion investment in AI infrastructure, with the URL.

Now, I'll sort these articles by date, starting from the latest. The latest date is 2025-06-30, and there are two articles on that date, so they should be ordered with the most recent first. I'll arrange them accordingly.

I need to make sure each entry is in the correct markdown format with the date as a header, followed by a bullet point with the summary and URL. I should check for any duplicates or overlaps, but it seems each article is unique.

I think that's all. I'll format them accordingly, ensuring each date is correct and the summaries are concise.
